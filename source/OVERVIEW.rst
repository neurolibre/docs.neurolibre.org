**NeuroLibre is a preprint server for interactive data analyses.** It is tailored for publishing interactive 
neuroscience notebooks that can seamlessly integrate data, text, code and figures.



+++++++++++++++
For authors, it takes two steps: ``test`` and ``submit``
+++++++++++++++

Our full-fledged (yet simple) submission workflow is designed to help researchers convert a collection of 
Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown files into publishable content. 

Providing online-executable runtimes and a powerful data caching system, NeuroLibre makes a **groundbreaking preprint
server where you can plant the seeds of living publications.**

.. seealso:: Before submitting: please read our `submission guidelines <https://docs.neurolibre.com/en/latest/SUBMIT.html>`_.

As an author and before submitting, you:

1. Create a github repository with notebooks that you would like to share.
2. Make a reproducible execution runtime for your notebooks by using `binder configuration files <https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/config_files.html>`_
3. Test your repository on `binder <https://mybinder.org/>`_.
4. Design a `Jupyter Book <https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html>`_ with all relevant bibliography.

+++++++++++++++
For readers, it takes one click
+++++++++++++++

The interactive outputs (such as interactive figures) are readily available in NeuroLibre preprints. Yet, if you'd like
to re-run the analyses and reproduce the outputs, our powerful cloud infrastructure is at the tip of your fingers.

+++++++++++++++
Contributions are welcome, NeuroLibre is fully open-source
+++++++++++++++

NeuroLibre draws its strength from community-developed tools such as `BinderHub <https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub>`_ and `Open Journals <https://github.com/openjournals>`_.
