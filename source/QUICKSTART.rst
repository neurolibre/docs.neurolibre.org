Quickstar guide for NRP
=======================

This quickstart guide will walk you through the steps to get started with the NRP service.

You will learn how to:

- Create a project with the neurolibre `template repository <https://github.com/neurolibre/template>`_
- Using `RoboNeuro <https://robo.neurolibre.org/>`_ to test your project.

For the full process, please refer to the remainder of the author guide.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. sidebar:: Set up GitHub credentials

   If you do not have a GitHub account, please create one and configure your credentials by following the instructions `here <https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git>`_.


To go through this guide, you will need:

- A GitHub account and GitHub credentials set up on your local machine.
- Basic understanding of how to use ``git`` commands ``clone``, ``add``, ``commit``, ``push``.
- Basic Python skill.
- A Jupyter notebook.

Step by step guide
------------------

1. Create the a neurolibre compatible project from the template repository.
    Got to the neurolibre `template repository <https://github.com/neurolibre/template>`_ and click the :kbd:`use this template` button on the template repository page. 
    The template should have all the necessary files and folders to get you started, and a basic example of how to edit each file.

2. Clone the project on your local machine.
    Click on the :kbd:`code` button on your repository page and copy the link. Then run the following command in your terminal.

    .. code-block:: bash

        git clone <what you copy-pasted>
        cd <your repository name>

3. Update `_config.yml`.
    You will need to update at least the following fields:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        title                       : "NeuroLibre preprint template"  # Add your title
        author                      : John Doe, Jane Doe  # Add author names
        repository:
            url: https://github.com/neurolibre/template  # The URL to your new repository

.. admonition:: Minimal example

    Once these fields are updated, this is enough for an minimal test on `RoboNeuro <https://robo.neurolibre.org/>`_.
    Skip to step 9 and 10 to see how to test your project.


4. Add your executable content under ``content/``
    - ✅ You can add a mixture of ``Jupyter Notebooks``, ``MyST`` formatted markdown and plain text markdown files.
    - ✅ You can organize your content in subfolders.
    - ❌ We don't accept (non-executable) plain text markdown files alone.

    We recommend to start testing with a project without the need to download data for demonstrative purpose.
    Please follow the full documentation to learn how to add data to your project.

5. Edit ``_toc.yml`` to add your new executable content.
    You can follow the example in the template repository.

6. Update ``binder/requirements.txt`` to add your new dependencies.
    Make sure you keep the ``Jupyter Notebook`` and ``Repo2Data`` dependency.
    Add other dependencies based on your executable content.

7. Edit ``paper.md`` and ``paper.bib`` to add your new content.
    You can follow the example in the template repository.

8. Build the project locally to test your changes. [Optional]
    .. code-block:: bash

        jupyter-book build content
    You can now open the ``content/_build/html/index.html`` file in your browser to see the result.

9. Commit and push the changes to your repository.
    .. code-block:: bash

        git add .
        git commit -m "update author information"

10. Go to `RoboNeuro <https://robo.neurolibre.org/>`_ and click on the :kbd:`Compile preprint` button.
    From here you can iterate on your project by going back to step 4!
