Structure your NRP repository
==============================

Scholarly publishing has evolved from the clunky days of typewriters and snail mail, to the digital age of electronic word documents.
The next step of the evolution takes root from a **GitHub repository** behold the NeuroLibre Reproducible Preprints (NRP)!

.. image:: https://github.com/neurolibre/brand/blob/main/png/nrp_init.png?raw=true
     :align: center
     :width: 800

The illustration above is a concise overview of the key components required to bring an NRP to life from a public GitHub repository.

.. admonition:: Prepare your NRP

   The following sections provide details on the expected layout of an NRP repository that lives on GitHub.

üü† :contentlabel:`The content folder`
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

To provide a powerful, flexible, and interactive way to create your preprint, NRPs are based on `the Jupyter Book <https://jupyterbook.org>`_.

.. image:: https://github.com/neurolibre/brand/blob/main/gif/content_interact.gif?raw=true
     :align: center
     :width: 500

When building the Jupyter Book for an NRP (which is a compact website), NeuroLibre expects locating your **Jupyter Notebooks** and/or **MyST Markdown** files
within a folder named :contentlabel:`content`.

.. sidebar:: üìë Reference documentations

   .. raw:: html

    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/myst.html" target="_blank">Writing narrative content</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/execute.html" target="_blank">Writing executable content</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/file-types/index.html" target="_blank">Allowed content types</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/citations.html" target="_blank">Citations and bibliography</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/interactive/interactive.html" target="_blank">Interactive outputs</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/structure/toc.html" target="_blank"><code>_toc.yml</code></a></li>
    <li><a href="https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/customize/config.html" target="_blank"><code>_config.yml</code></a></li>
    </ul>

Inside the :contentlabel:`content` directory, you have the freedom to organize the ``SOURCE`` files as per your preference::

    root/
    ‚îú‚îÄ content/
    ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ _toc.yml                  [REQUIRED]
    ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ _config.yml               [REQUIRED]
    ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ _neurolibre.yml           [OPTIONAL]
    ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ my_notebook.ipynb         [SOURCE]
    ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ my_myst.md                [SOURCE]
    ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ MY FOLDER
    ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ another_notebook.ipynb [SOURCE]

|
‚ÑπÔ∏è The relationship between the source files and the table of contents of your NRP must be defined in the :kbd:`content/_toc.yml` file, as it is a 
``REQUIRED`` component.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Another ``REQUIRED`` component is the  :kbd:`content/_config.yml` to customize the appearance and behavior of your Jupyter Book.


.. admonition:: üíª Supported programming languages
   :class: random

   NRPs, being part of the Jupyter ecosystem, offer the flexibility to utilize a wide range of programming languages, 
   provided they do not require a license (e.g., MATLAB is not supported yet, but you can use Octave).

   You can take advantage of any language that has a compatible  kernel listed in the `Jupyter kernels <https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels>`_ for writing the 
   executable content of your NRP.

   Another important consideration is to ensure that `BinderHub configurations <https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/sample_repos.html>`_ support the language
   of your choice, or you know how to create a Dockerfile to establish a reproducible runtime environment. Further detail on this matter is provided in the 
   following (green) section.

.. admonition:: üìù Managing citations and bibliography in your reproducible preprint
   :class: dropdown newcontent

   To cite articles in your reproducible preprint, include your bibtex formatted bibliographic entries in a :kbd:`paper.bib` file located at the root of your repository,
   which is the same bibliography used by the companion PDF. 
   
   To point the Jupyter Book build to the relevant bibliography, add the following to the :kbd:`content/_config.yml` file: 

   .. code-block:: yaml

    bibtex_bibfiles:
       - ../paper.bib
    sphinx:
       config:
          bibtex_reference_style: author_year
    
   For further details regarding the management of citations and bibliography in Jupyter Book, please see the `reference docs <https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/citations.html>`_.

.. admonition:: ‚ûï Reproducible preprint in disguise (traditional article layout)
   :class: dropdown newcontent

   If you prefer your reproducible preprint to have a layout resembling a traditional article ‚Äî single page and without sidebars ‚Äî 
   you can achieve this by creating your content in a single Notebook or MyST markdown file. Additionally, include a :kbd:`content/_neurolibre.yml` 
   file with the following content:

   .. code-block:: yaml

    book_layout: traditional
    single_page: index.ipynb # The notebook/MyST that creates the whole preprint.
  
   See an `example <https://preview.neurolibre.org/book-artifacts/rrsg2020/github.com/paper/562fb392105e48b5da7a4b6bfcf82d7504ea7c71/_build/_page/index/singlehtml>`_ of an NRP that combines the appearance of a traditional article with the powerful features of a Jupyter Book.

.. admonition:: üéö Make the most of your NRP with interactive visualizations
   :class: newcontent

   We strongly recommend incorporating interactive visualizations, such as those offered by `plotly <https://plotly.com/>`_, to enhance the value of your NRP.

   By utilizing interactive visualizations, you can fully leverage the potential of your figures and present your data in a more engaging and insightful manner.
   
   You can visit the `reference JupyterBook documentation <https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/interactive/interactive.html?highlight=interactive>`_ to have your interactive outputs rendered in your NRP.  

   ‚ùóÔ∏èCompatibility of this format with citations and bibliography has not been tested yet.

üü¢ :binderunlabel:`The binder folder (runtime)`
::::::::::::::::::

One of the essential features of NRPs is the provision of dedicated BinderHub instances for the published preprints. 
This empowers readers and researchers to interactively explore and reproduce the findings presented in the NRP through 
a web browser, without installing anything to their computers.

.. image:: https://github.com/neurolibre/brand/blob/main/gif/binder_folder.gif?raw=true
     :align: center
     :width: 500

By leveraging NeuroLibre's BinderHub, each NRP receives its isolated computing environment, ensuring that the code, data, and 
interactive elements remain fully functional and accessible. 

The NRP repository's :binderunlabel:`binder` folder contains all the essential runtime descriptions to tailor such isolated computing
environments for each reproducible preprint.

.. admonition:: ‚öôÔ∏è How to setup your runtime
   :class: binderun
   
   To specify your runtime and set up the necessary configuration files for your runtime environment, please refer to the `binderhub configuration files documentation <https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/config_files.html>`_. 
   
   To implement this in your NRP repository, create a :binderunlabel:`binder` folder and place the appropriate configuration files inside it according to your runtime requirements. These configuration files will define the environment in which your preprint's code 
   and interactive elements will run when accessed through NeuroLibre's BinderHub.

.. admonition:: ‚ö†Ô∏è NeuroLibre specific dependencies
   :class: binderun

   As we build a Jupyter Book for your NRP in the exact same runtime you defined, we need the following Python dependencies 
   to be present. For example, in a :kbd:`binder/_requirements.txt` file::

      repo2data>=2.6.0
      jupyter-book==0.14.0

   ‚ùóÔ∏èWe recommend not using ``jupyter-book`` versions newer than ``0.14.0`` as of July 2023.

   Currently, we are using ``repo2data`` to download the dataset needed to run your executable content. For details, please see the following (blue) section.

.. admonition:: üîó Example runtime environments
   :class: dropdown binderun

   You can explore the `binder-examples GitHub organization <https://github.com/binder-examples>`_ to find useful examples of configuration files.

   Moreover, for additional insights and inspiration, you can visit the `roboneurolibre GitHub organization <https://github.com/roboneurolibre>`_ to explore various NRP repositories. 
   Observe how each preprint defines its runtimes and customizes the Binder environment to suit their research needs.

.. admonition:: üîã  Ensuring reproducibility and resource allocation in NRPs
   :class: binderun

   As of July 2023, each NRP Jupyter Book build is allocated the following resources:

   * 8 hours of execution time 
   * 1 or 2 CPUs at 3GHz
   * 6GB of RAM

   Please note that the Jupyter Book build (``book build``) occurs only after a successful ``runtime build`` (BinderHub). 
   The resource allocations mentioned above apply specifically to the ``book build``.
   
   Understanding the distinction between the ``runtime build`` and ``book build`` is crucial for adhering to reproducible practices. 
   
   **It is strongly advised NOT to download external dependencies during the book build**, as NeuroLibre cannot guarantee their long-term preservation. 
   As a best practice, all runtime dependencies should be handled during the ``runtime build`` using the BinderHub configuration files.


üîµ :binderdatalabel:`The binder folder (data)`
::::::::::::::::::

NeuroLibre Reproducible Preprints (NRPs) aim to distill your analysis into reproducible insights.
One of the core requirements for achieving this goal is to have access to the dataset used in the analysis.

Currently, we utilize a work-in-progress tool called ``repo2data`` to facilitate the downloading of your dataset to our 
servers and to associate it with the NRP you are building. To locate the necessary information, NeuroLibre searches for the :kbd:`binder/data_requirement.json` file.


.. admonition:: üíΩ Content of the **data_requirement.json**
   :class: binderdata

   Currently, repo2data is compatible with public download URIs from the following providers:
   
   * Google Drive 
   * Amazon S3
   * OSF
   * Zenodo
   * Datalad

   ‚ùóÔ∏èData will not be downloaded if the URL is not from one of the providers above.

   .. code-block:: json

     { "src": "https://download/url/of/the/dataset",
      "dst": "/location/of/the/data/relative/to/the/binder/folder",
      "projectName": "unique_project_name"}
   
   ‚ùóÔ∏èThe ``dst`` field above is not considered when your data is downloaded to the NeuroLibre servers. 
   On the server-side, data is set to be available at the ``data/unique_project_name`` directory, where the ``data`` folder is (read-only) mounted 
   to the root of your repository, i.e. next to the ``binder`` and ``content`` folders.

   ‚ùóÔ∏èTherefore, the ``dst`` key is only important when you are testing your notebook locally. For example, if your ``data_requirement.json`` is the following

   .. code-block:: json

     { "src": "https://...",
      "dst": "../../",
      "projectName": "my_nrp_data"}
   
   then repo2data will download the data in a folder named ``data/my_nrp_data`` that is next to the folder that contains your repository, as two upper directories correspond to that location.

   ‚≠êÔ∏è Nevertheless, you don't have to manually identify the folder location. Instead, you can use the following pattern in Python:

   .. code-block:: python

      from repo2data.repo2data import Repo2Data
      import os
      data_req_path = os.path.join("..","..", "binder", "data_requirement.json") # Change with respect to the location of your notebook
      repo2data = Repo2Data(data_req_path)
      data_path = repo2data.install()[0]
      my_data = os.path.join(data_path,'my_data.nii.gz')
   
   In the example above, the notebook that uses repo2data is under the ``content/00/my_notebook.ipybn``. Consequently, the ``data_requirement.json`` was located in two directories above.

After being downloaded to the server, any subsequent attempts to re-download the data will be disregarded unless modifications are made to the ``data_requirement.json`` file.

.. admonition:: üìÄ Data allocation
   :class: binderdata

   As of July 2023, each NRP is allowed to:

   * use up to 10GB of data (to be downloaded from a trusted source)
   * around 8GB of runtime storage (derivatives generated after executing your book)

.. admonition:: üóú If you are sharing a compressed file archive (e.g., zip)
   :class: dropdown binderdata

   Please ensure that the parent directory is not included in the archive. Otherwise, when the 
   data is automatically extracted, repo2data will not be able to locate the actual content.

   To achieve this on osx:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
     cd /to/your/data/directory
     zip -r my_data.zip . -x ".*" -x "__MACOSX"
   
   Similarly on Ubuntu:

   .. code-block:: bash

     cd /to/your/data/directory && zip -r ../my_data.zip .


.. admonition:: ‚¨áÔ∏è Using Google Drive to share your NRP data
   :class: dropdown binderdata

   Please make sure that your Drive folder (or the zip file) is publicly available, then locate your project ID (a complex array of 33 characters that you can find on the url).

   Then you can construct the download url with that ID: ``https://drive.google.com/uc?id=${PROJECT_ID}``

   Example ``data_requirement.json``:

   .. code-block:: json

      { "src": "https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_zeJqQP8umrTk-evSAt3wCLxAkTKo0lC",
      "dst": "./data",
      "projectName": "my_data_in_gdrive"}

.. admonition:: ‚¨áÔ∏è Using Datalad to share your NRP data
   :class: dropdown binderdata

   If the ``src`` is provided with a URI that ends in ``.git``, Repo2Data will then use the ``datalad`` to download the data.
   
   .. code-block:: json

      { "src": "https://github.com/OpenNeuroDatasets/ds000005.git",
      "dst": "./data",
      "projectName": "repo2data_datalad"}

.. admonition:: ‚¨áÔ∏è Using S3 to share your NRP data
   :class: dropdown binderdata

   If the ``src`` url starts with ``s3://``, Repo2Data will use ``aws s3 sync --no-sign-request`` to download your data.

   .. code-block:: json

      { "src": "s3://openneuro.org/ds000005",
      "dst": "./data",
      "projectName": "repo2data_s3"}

.. admonition:: ‚¨áÔ∏è Using OSF to share your NRP data
   :class: dropdown binderdata

   Repo2Data uses ``osfclient osf -p PROJECT_ID clone`` command. 
   You will need to provide the link to the public project containing your data https://osf.io/.../:

   .. code-block:: json

      { "src": "https://osf.io/fuqsk/",
      "dst": "./data",
      "projectName": "repo2data_osf"}

   If you need to download subsets from a larger a project, you can achieve this using the remote_filepath field which runs 
   ``osf -p PROJECT_ID fetch -f file`` command. For example:

   .. code-block:: json

      { "src": "https://osf.io/fuqsk/",
      "remote_filepath": ["hello.txt", "test-subfolder/hello-from-subfolder.txt"],
      "dst": "./data",
      "projectName": "repo2data_osf_multiple"}

.. admonition:: ‚¨áÔ∏è Using Zenodo to share your NRP data
   :class: dropdown binderdata

   We also support the use of the public data repository Zenodo through "zenodo_get." 
   Ensure that your project is public and has a DOI with the form "10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX."

   .. code-block:: json

      { "src": "10.5281/zenodo.6482995",
      "dst": "./data",
      "projectName": "repo2data_zenodo"}

   ‚ùóÔ∏èIf this is the case, please indicate dutring the submission that you already have a DOI for your dataset, so that the
   NeuroLibre publication workflow skips the data archival step.

‚ö´Ô∏è :contentpdflabel:`The companion PDF`
::::::::::::::::::

To publish your NRP as a preprint, a PDF is necessary. Our PDF template integrates all the reproducibility assets created 
at the end of a successful book build as part of the publication.

To create a PDF, two files are required: :kbd:`paper.md` and :kbd:`paper.bib` at the root of your NRP repository.

.. admonition:: ‚úçÔ∏è Authors and affiliations
   :class: contentpdf

   The front matter of ``paper.md`` is used to collect meta-information about your preprint:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      ---
      title: 'White matter integrity of developing brain in everlasting childhood'
      tags:
         - Tag1
         - Tag2

      date: 08 September 1991
      bibliography: paper.bib
      ---

   ‚ùóÔ∏èPlease pay careful attention when editing this section as the author names, ORCID IDs, and affiliations specified 
   here will be used for the archival of the reproducibility assets, as well as for the published preprint. 
   Ensuring the accuracy of this information is crucial, as any inaccuracies may result in researchers not being properly 
   attributed for their contributions. 

The corpus of this static document (:kbd:`paper.md`) is intended for a big picture summary of the preprint
generated by the executable and narrative content you provided (in the ``content``) folder. You can include citations
to this document from an accompanying BibTex bibliography file ``paper.bib``.

.. admonition:: üìù Testing the PDF compilation
   :class: dropdown contentpdf

   Contrary to what publishing giants may lead you to believe, creating a PDF is a relatively straightforward process.

   In fact, we have simplified it by utilizing GitHub actions to compile your draft PDF automatically within just a few minutes 
   after each commit you push to your repository. This streamlined approach ensures that you can focus on your work while effortlessly 
   generating the PDF without any manual hassle.

   Add a file ``.github/workflows/draft-pdf.yml`` to your repository with the following content (also available in the `template repository <https://github.com/neurolibre/template/blob/main/.github/workflows/draft-paper.yml>`_):

   .. code-block:: yaml

      on: [push]

      jobs:
      paper:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         name: Paper Draft
         steps:
            - name: Checkout
            uses: actions/checkout@v3
            - name: Build draft PDF
            uses: neurolibre/neurolibre-draft-action@master
            with:
               journal: neurolibre
               # This should be the path to the paper within your repo.
               paper-path: paper.md
            - name: Upload
            uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
            with:
               name: paper
               # This is the output path where Pandoc will write the compiled
               # PDF. Note, this should be the same directory as the input
               # paper.md
               path: paper.pdf
   
   After a successful build, the draft PDF will be available as an artifact :guilabel:`Your Repo -> Actions -> Latest Run -> Artifacts -> paper.zip`
